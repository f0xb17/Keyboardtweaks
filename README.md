# Keyboard Tweaks
This repo aims to provide sample tweaks for you to use with [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (Windows) or [Keysmith](https://www.keysmith.app/) (macOS).
<p>I started that repo because I bought myself an ANSI Keyboard. After days of usage, I faced an issue while trying to add 'greater than' or 'lesser than' to my code. As a trained ISO user, it was very complicated to remember the new position on the keyboard.</p> 
<p>So, basically, I wrote a script that made it easier for me to work with those signs on the keyboard.</p>
<p>I'm only working with TKL and 60% keyboards, so I also found a cheap way of emulating NUM for using it with Blender (or basically any other software that needs NUM).</p>

## Todo
- [ ] implementing NUM with macOS
- [ ] finding new way for macOS

## Building
### Windows
<p>
Install Autohotkey and follow their steps to create an executable file. My suggestion is to add this to “shell:startup” (Autostart on newer Windows Systems), so you never lose functionality.</p>
